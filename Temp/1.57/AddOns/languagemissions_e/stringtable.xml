                        &lt;b&gt;ARMED TAKISTANI LOCAL GROUPS&lt;b /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                        Several armed groups operate amongst the local populace, the &lt;b&gt;Takistani Militia&lt;b /&gt;, which support and uphold the ideals of the current regime, and the local &lt;b&gt;Guerilla&lt;b /&gt;, who strongly reject this pretentious government.&lt;br /&gt;
                        Of these groups, the Guerilla are supportive of the US operation, and have provided assistance to our forces on several occasions. It is important to be able to distinguish between these two factions, especially considering the civilian populace sides with the Guerilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                        In comparsion with Militia, Guerilla forces usually wear ordinary clothing, lacking any Military-like ranks or symbols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b /&gt;
                        It pays to keep an eye out for these differences, as opening fire on a group of Guerilla who are coming to help will certainly not help the situation.

          <English>There are five sectors alltogether. Each sector contauns three flags to capture and hold. Each team begins on different Respawn Base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding flags fills your team score bar. When the bar is full, team wins the sector and the fight moves towards its enemy base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sector with the base has only one flag and the defending team is already holding it. The attacking team has to capture and hold it as long as possible. The rules of capturing are the same for each sector. The team with more points wins the battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img image='img\diary_sectors_ca.paa' width='300' align='center' /&gt;</English>
