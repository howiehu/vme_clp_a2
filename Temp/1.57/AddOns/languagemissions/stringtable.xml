                        Today we have the training range all to ourselves. You can refresh your basic skills in the training camp. When you're done there you should drive our team's humvee up to the heavy weapons range. There you'll have the chance to try some man-portable anti-tank weapons and take part in a simulated fight for an abandoned village. We recommended you complete the other training sessions before trying out the MOUT (Military Operation in Urban Terrain) course.
                        To end the mission approach Sgt Miles or contact him by radio at any time between courses.

            <English>You will take part in some refreshment training for High-Altitude-Low-Opening (HALO) jump techniques. Everyone's objective is to hit the designated landing zone as precisely as possible. You will be inserted at 1000 meters approximately 1 km from the objective. You should free-fall towards the objective, then open your parachute at an altitude between 300 and 100 meters. The LZ is indicated by a white cross; ground staff will pop green smoke nearby to aid identification. You must land within a 20 meter radius of the objective. To achieve the Naval Parachutist Badge, land no more than 6 meters from the objective. After the first jump, you may retry or end the mission by talking to the officer at the LZ or via radio.</English>

                        As part of your refreshment training, today you will have the chance to experience the life of a tanker. First you will attempt to manoeuvre the M1 Abrams around the training polygon, then man the gunnery position and neutralize a few practice targets. When you complete this stage you will be given command of the entire vehicle and learn to issue basic movement and fire orders. The first part of your training session will be concluded by familiarization with basic maintenance procedures. In the second phase the vehicle will be placed under your command and you will be able to train freely on the armor range.
                        Training can be terminated at any time between courses by contacting an instructor.

          <English>USEUCOM has finally approved the deployment of a Marine Expeditionary Unit to Chernarus. The 27th MEU is en route, baby! We're going in! Hell, yesterday I didn't even know Chernarus existed and tomorrow I'll be fighting for her. Soon as I found out where we were headed I did some research on the internet. It's one of those tiny, half-forgotten nation states rolling around in eastern Europe, what's left of the old Soviet bloc. They've been squabbling over the scraps since the early nineties but the last two years were a rare period of peace. Some semi-democratic corrupt government (who's isn't?) got elected and that calmed things down for a while. But there's been something of a communist uprising recently. This summer, large numbers of separatist guerrillas clashed with the government forces (the Chernarussian Defence Force), and now there are parts of the country not under central control. That's why we're here. Re-establish government order, kick some ass, save the day. If nothing else, it makes a change from the sand!</English>

          <English>Aboard the USS Khe Sanh the 27th MEU are 50 miles off the southern coast of Chernarus. An irregular force of volunteer partisans under the political banner of the ChDKZ - The Chernarussian Red Star Movement - or 'Chedaki' to the locals, have seized control of large parts of the north eastern province. Information leaking out of the country suggests high civilian casualties in these areas. The region lies on top of an ethnic fault line of Chernarussian nationals and Russian settlers left over from the soviet era. Although recognized by Russia, the Kremlin has already snubbed the ChDKZ by refusing to absorb the break away region into the Federation. The Russians don't want to get involved, and so we must.</English>

          <English>Tonight's the night. &lt;br /&gt; The first mission of a new Op. Nothing like that feeling, mixes your guts up real good. The Red Star Movement (ChDKZ) know we're out here - it's kinda hard to miss a WASP class carrier sitting off the coast - but they don't know exactly what we'll do just yet. I guess they're still hoping it's a show of force. But this dog's got bite! &lt;br /&gt; Hopefully they'll put up a bit of a fight all the same. Hate getting all wound up only to see 'em fall over their AK's trying to surrender... They seem to have handled themselves OK until now, but then they've only had a bunch of girl-scout Chernarussian Defence Force to deal with. &lt;br /&gt; The legitimate government army didn't exactly shine during the 'September crisis'. Life's about to get a whole-lot tougher for those poor ChDKZ bastards. We're coming to get you boys! Hope you brought some spare undies! Here's a photo I found on the internet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img image='CA\Missions\campaign\missions\C1_IntoTheStorm.Chernarus\img\chdkz_ca.paa' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fierce looking, but I'm sure they'll run like hell when they see us.</English>

                        Name:&lt;br/&gt;Andrey Lopotev aka 'Akula' ('Shark' or 'The Shark')&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date/Place of Birth&lt;br/&gt;July 24th 1965, Solnichniy, Chernarus (then CSSR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position:&lt;br/&gt;Leader and co-founder of the The Chernarussian Red Star Movement (ChDKZ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;In 1997 Lopotev formed the 'Working Man's Defence Alliance' pseudo-union along with other employees of the Solnichniy Quarry Corporation. In 1999 he organized a participated in a violent protest over pay and conditions that lead to at least three deaths, unconfirmed injuries (figures vary from 10s to 100s) and a dozen prosecutions. Later he formed the ChDKZ along with several previous members of the Working Man's Defence Alliance. The party's main line is that of reintegration with the Russian Federation. The attempted coup (see September Crisis) and failed reunification talks with Moscow have left 'The Shark' and his party politically isolated in recent months despite official recognition of their political and military wings by the Kremlin (if not the western world).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name:&lt;br/&gt;MikolaBardak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                        Date/Place of Birth&lt;br/&gt;September 3rd 1969, Solnichniy, Chernarus (then CSSR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position:&lt;br/&gt;
                        Shadow Justice Secretary and co-founder of the The Chernarussian Red Star Movement (ChDKZ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;Although officially Shadow Justice Secretary for the ChDKZ Bardak is more commonly known as the head of 'Sotnya Syem' (Group Seven), the ChDKZ secret police organization. A former Solnichniy Quarry Corporation employee Bardak was one of the original members of Andrey Lopotev's 'Working Man's Defence Alliance' naturally becoming a powerful figure in the party after his release from prison following the riots of 1999. On the surface Bardak is cosmopolitan, seen as far more of a 'statesman' than Lopotev, even among the party loyalists. He is well-traveled and educated and is often seen as a more 'rational' and viable leader than 'The Shark' by those fortunate enough not to be familiar with his Group Seven activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name:&lt;br/&gt;Kostey (real name unknown)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date/Place of Birth&lt;br/&gt;December 12th 1974, Tulga, Chernarus (then CSSR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position:&lt;br/&gt;Key figure in the paramilitary wing of The Chernarussian Red Star Movement (ChDKZ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;Kostey was a small time criminal and poacher who served a manslaughter sentence for shooting and killing a game keeper in the late 90's. During his time in prison Kostey fell in with Mikola Bardak and upon release became a member of the then-burgeoning ChDKZ movement. Quickly establishing himself as a quick and unscrupulous fighter Kostey was fundamental in the growth and organisation of the early muscle behind Lopotev's party. More than a simple thug, Kostey is widely acknowledged to be an intelligent and able leader of men. This is not to say the self-styled 'General' is a stable man, far from it, Kostey is extremely unpredictable though fiercely loyal to his ChDKZ masters.

            <English>The explosion, which tore through crowds of early morning shoppers and site-seers also damaged the iconic St. Basil's Cathedral. The Russian media have been quick to blame the current conflict here in Chernarus as the catalyst for today's attack, unashamedly pointing the finger of blame at the organization of resistance fighters known as NAPA. Other less-biased analysts believe the bombing to be the work of an isolated group of fanatics unconnected with NAPA or any other Chernarussian group.</English>

            <English>The death toll is almost certain to rise.

            <English>This is the GBR Global Service Report. As many as fifty people are thought to have been killed and around one hundred seriously injured in the attack which shook Moscow's famous Red Square earlier today. Many of the victims were foreign tourists visiting the Square which is flanked by both the Kremlin and St. Basil's Cathedral. The iconic Cathedral also took damage in the blast. GBR's Moscow correspondent John McNully had this report.</English>

            <English>Clearly the explosion this morning in Red Square highlights the need, in the most tragic way imaginable, for greater Russian engagement in the troubles of this region." That's a quote from a State Duma minister talking to me shortly after the Red Square bombing this morning. Minutes later we were asked by Kremlin officials not to use the interview, or even name the minister until the Kremlin make an official statement later today. It's amazing that we managed to speak to anyone inside the Kremlin at all this morning. Journalists, like everyone else, have been banned from the Square itself. A cordon of five hundred meters has been set up around the city center and a no-fly zone is in place over the whole city. The only pictures we can get are taken from the roofs of nearby hotels and other buildings. Confusion reigns in the Kremlin and indeed across all Moscow in the aftermath of the bombing. Initial reports from reliable government sources initially suggested the attack had been the work of the Chernarussian guerilla group NAPA but these claims were swiftly retracted by officials who denied any organization was officially being held responsible. This hasn't stopped many parts of the Russian media leaping on those early statements and running with the NAPA story. The truth is that here in Russia, fears about the Chernarussian conflict spilling over into the motherland are sky-high, however irrational, and so far, the Kremlin isn't doing much to talk the people down.

          <English>We're being redeployed to the mountainous region in the Northeast around Krasnostav. We've established an FOB up there to help the CDF keep the locals under control. Despite most of Chernarus now being under nominal CDF control this region is proving troublesome for the brass on both sides of the alliance. A guerilla group called NAPA are harassing the Chedaki and normally that'd be fine by me, but they're not keeping their reprisals to combatants. The CDF simply don't have the right stuff for this kind of conflict (I'm tempted to say any type of conflict...) so once again we have to bail them out.

          <English>The Chernarussian Defence Force is in control of the majority of the country thanks to the swift and decisive involvement of the USMC. However, insurgency is on the increase. The Krasnostav area is still seeing heavy counter-insurgency fighting between the CDF, ChDKZ ''Sotnya'' remnants and NAPA guerilla groups. Although enemies of the ChDKZ, there is no 'official' line concerning the NAPA group's attitude toward the USMC and it's allies. They should be approached with caution. The ChDKZ are operating from the forests that dominate this area of operation, popping up for occasional hit and run strikes on weak targets. Forward Operating Base 'Manhattan' has been established east of the town of Krasnostav to deal with the conflict in this area. Immediate USMC intervention is needed to assist the CDF who largely lack the appropriate counter-insurgency training for this area of operations. Our role in the AO is to find and eliminate key ChDKZ personnel, camps, strong-points and supporters. Razor Team will redeploy from Elektrozavodsk and rendezvous at FOB Manhattan checkpoint 'Brooklyn'. From there Razor should report to Capt. Shaftoe re: their deployment in the AO. &lt;br /&gt; Layout of FOB Manhattan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img image='img\C3_PLHmanhattanlayout_ca.paa' /&gt;</English>

          <English>The Krasnostav area is a deeply divided region of Chernarus. Local attitudes toward the CDF (and their allies) are fickle at best. While we can expect some support from the local population there are many ethic Russian settlers in this area who feel threatened by the CDF/USMC presence and the legitimacy this could be seen to lend the anti-ChDKZ militias such as NAPA. Our goal is to minimize the conflict in this area, not encourage rival militia violence. NAPA activity is highest in the west where there have been some attacks on ChDKZ sympathizers, as well as direct firefights between NAPA and ChDKZ. &lt;br /&gt; Chedaki activity near Krasnostav: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img image='img\C3_PLHactivityChDKZ_ca.paa' /&gt;</English>

          <English>The Krasnostav area is a deeply divided region of Chernarus. Local attitudes toward the CDF (and their allies) are fickle at best. While we can expect some support from the local population there are many ethnic Russian settlers in this area who feel threatened by the CDF/USMC presence and the legitimacy this could be seen to lend the anti-ChDKZ militias such as NAPA. Our goal is to ultimately minimize the conflict in this area, not encourage rival militia violence.

          <English>Talk about 'Out of the frying pan...'. We're being redeployed to the mountainous region in the Northeast around Krasnostav. We've established an FOB up there to help the CDF keep the locals under control. Despite most of Chernarus now being under nominal CDF control, this region is proving troublesome for the brass on both sides of the alliance. A guerilla group called NAPA is harassing the 'Chedaki' and normally that'd be fine by me, but they're not keeping their reprisals to combatants. The CDF simply don't have the right stuff for this kind of conflict (I'm tempted to say any type of conflict...) so once again we have to bail them out. I just hope this doesn't turn into another quagmire.</English>

            <English>Sure. OK listen up Marines, we caught a break. One of the Lopotev's under-lieutenants wants to defect and spill his guts about the ChDKZ, Moscow and all the rest.</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_1">
            <English>Spukayev, that's the guy, can confirm the involvement of ChDKZ operatives in what they call 'Operation Cobalt', the Moscow bombing.</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_2">
            <English>Now by rights his evidence, along with the other documents we have, should convince the Russians that the ChDKZ are the real threat here.</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_3">
            <English>But Spukayev is worried. The Russians have moved so fast on this thing everyone's left guessing who to trust.</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_4">
            <English>There's just too much room for error out there. Now the Russian 'peacekeepers' are moving in we need to extract Spukayev and recover his files before something goes wrong.</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_5">
            <English>The Russians have restricted our airspace to evacuation flight paths only, so your Huey transports are out for these objectives.</English>

          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_d_6">
            <English>All right. Spukayev's blown any ties he had with the ChDKZ calling for this extraction so they are probably already en route to his house. Don't let them get there before you Razor Team.</English>

            <English>Simmons, I'm sending your team in after him. Cooper, Spukayev has a safehouse west of Krasnostav at 028104. I want you to take Razor and recover those files.</English>

          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_s_2">
            <English>Razor, take a Hummer and get to that safehouse ASAP. Return to Manhattan with the files and Star Force 21 will extract you to back to the Khe Sanh.</English>

          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_s_3">
            <English>There won't be much of the FOB left by the time you get back. As you know our deadline for complete withdrawal is 1700hrs. After that, there won't be a marine within fifty miles of Chernarus, understood?</English>
          </Key>
          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_s_4">
            <English>Simmons, Spukayev himself is at Khelm so your part in this won't take long. Rendezvous with him there and provide a safe escort back here for extraction.</English>

          <Key ID="str_dressler_briefing_s_5">
            <English>When you have the Plan Cobalt files, destroy any other materials that could be deemed sensitive. We can't let the Russians or his former employers get their hands on it.</English>

          <English>The 27th MEU is leaving Chernarussian territory today, 17. October 2009 at 1700hrs, to be replaced by Russian Federation peacekeepers. The Kremlin claimed that USMC forces were incapable of controlling terrorist organizations - namely NAPA - convincing the UN to rescind it's approval. Many feel the Russians would have invaded anyway and that the UN complied so as not to seem toothless should the Federation act unilaterally. Without UN backing, the US feel forced to abandon Chernarus to the Russians. After the attack on Moscow sympathy and support for this position is widespread, with global public opinion and many national governments supporting the move. Razor Team will secure FOB Manhattan until it is dismantled and will then transfer directly to the Khe Sanh, leaving the region via the Khardaran strait. The transition from US to Russian control will of necessity be chaotically swift, USEUCOM has ordered there be no contact between the two powers.</English>

        <English>Overview&lt;br/&gt;In Warfare two sides composed of several teams and led by a commander, fight over a large part of the map. The elected commander builds and maintains a base, while the other players purchase equipment and units for their teams. The commander also assigns missions to other Teams (player or AI), coordinating their actions in a particular strategy. Each player leads one team, fighting the enemy and capturing cities to gain resources. Players can also request Support e.g. airstrikes or transport. The winner is the last side with a base still standing.</English>
      </Key>
      <Key ID="str_hint_wf_02">
        <English>Base&lt;br/&gt;Base Buildings are built in the Construction interface by the commander in exchange for Supply Points. Base Defenses can be built by anyone. Players may buy equipment and human units after a Barracks is built, soft vehicles after a Light Vehicle Supply Point is built, armor after a Heavy Vehicle Supply Point is built, helicopters after a Helipad is built and planes after an Airfield is captured. There are also various radar systems, UAV terminals and so on in the Base Building category. Base Defenses include artillery pieces, static AA/AT weapons, barricades, trenches, walls etc. Remember: Base Buildings cost Supply Points, Defense structures only cost money. If your base is destroyed, you lose the game! Bases are 'destroyed' when the HQ is down along with all buildings inside a ~200m perimeter.</English>

        <English>Buying equipment&lt;br/&gt;When a Building is built (Barracks, Light or Heavy Vehicle Supply Point, Helipad) or an Airfield is captured, you may buy equipment and units from them. Approach the Building and select the 'Buy Equipment' or 'Buy units' action. A menu similar to the Gear menu will appear. Use this menu to buy equipment for units within your team, including yourself. You can also tab between multiple nearby factories in the same way that equipment filtering works in the Gear menu.</English>

The commander assigns missions to all teams on his side, player or AI, via the high command interface.</English>

        <English>Resources&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of resources in Warfare: Supply Points and money. Money is earned by completing missions and killing enemies. Supply Points are generated by Supply Trucks. As soon as you capture a city a Supply Truck departs from your base on route to that city - after it reaches the city's Supply Depot a number of Supply Points are generated - the more trips, the more SP's. Supply Points are spent by the commander for Base Buildings, whereas money is spent by everyone for buying equipment, units and Base Defenses. Money can be transferred from player to player via. the Diary.</English>

                        The wholescale invasion to Chernarus starts at 0600 GMT+4. The primary objectives are cities Novigrad, Primorsk, Tulan and Berezino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our task is to secure &lt;marker name='berezino'&gt;Berezino&lt;/marker&gt; and prepare for the deployment of the rest of the troops. The operation will then continue by securing &lt;marker name='olymp'&gt;an airfield&lt;/marker&gt; and the state &lt;marker name='border'&gt;border&lt;/marker&gt; before the move to the Russian Federation begins.&lt;img image='ca\missions_ew\img\plan_ca.paa' width='330' height='260' /&gt;,

                        You'll get to the position through an uninhabited area in the &lt;marker name='arrow_2'&gt;northern parts&lt;/marker&gt; of the country. Fly low in order to avoid enemy radar detection – an altitude under 100 metres will be enough. Any possible enemy contact before reaching your position has to be reported to HQ. Only HQ may authorize you to open fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close to &lt;marker name='olymp'&gt;the airport&lt;/marker&gt; you'll use some high ground as &lt;marker name='sparta'&gt;concealment&lt;/marker&gt; while you destroy any aircraft attempting to take off. The airfield's AA defences are strong, so don't get too close. Up-to-date information on numbers and types of enemy targets will be transmitted to you on the spot from spy satellites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last part of the mission is in the &lt;marker name='marathon'&gt;mountains to the north&lt;/marker&gt; where you must find a firing position with good cover. We expect &lt;marker name='border'&gt;incoming&lt;/marker&gt; enemy choppers you'll have to intercept. The mission will be over when all of your guided missiles have been fired.,

Artillery strikes are off the table since we need the airstrip undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later you'll move to &lt;marker name='marathon'&gt;a point in the mountains&lt;/marker&gt; where you'll assume a firing position and destroy incoming choppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Codenames&lt;br /&gt;SPARTA - position close to the airfield&lt;br /&gt;OLYMPUS - the airfield&lt;br /&gt;MARATHON - position in the mountains,

Ground Combat Elements of the 27th MEU made land on the shores of the Northern Province in an attempt to flank the Russian forces and capture key ports. Right now, the Russian 454th Guard Motor Rifle Regiment are preparing to hit the marines hard and deny them the bridgehead. If the USMC manage to neutralize this advance guard and hold the majority of the objectives, the Russian mainforce will have to withdraw to defend their flank.</English>

          <English>Ground Combat Elements of the 27th MEU successfully captured all objectives and taught the Guards Motor Rifles a lesson they won't quickly forget. The extraordinary success of this amphibious assault gained the American forces several days to reinforce before attempting to break through enemy lines. </English>

          <English>The 27th MEU succeeded in capturing several objectives, but the coming hours will decide the fate of the Marines in the Northern Province. The American bridgehead may prove too small to face the Russian counterattack which is already building, heading East to reinforce the 454th Guards Regiment. </English>

          <English>The 27th MEU are in dire straits. The defensive perimeter is probably too small and the logistical infrastructure too weak for American troops to hold out for long. The deployed Marines' only hope for securing Northern Chernarus lay in better assaults over the coming hours. </English>

          <English>American forces suffered a bitter defeat. The 27th MEU was unable to hold any territory or defend their command and logistical structures against the Russian counterattack. We lost the battle, let's hope we can still win the war.</English>

        <Key ID="tidalwave.sqf6">
          <English>During the first hours of the amphibious assault, we expect to meet a disciplined and well-trained force of mechanized infantry, characterized by strong ground reconnaissance elements and experienced armored units. We also expect formidable air defenses, although their deployment will be hampered by the dynamic nature of this engagement. It's possible that our troops will also be engaged by paramilitaries or guerilla fighters, especially if the US presence is deemed to be a threat by the local population. Thus far, no organized resistance has been reported. The native regular army and police force have abandoned this Area of Operations. </English>

            <English>Gentlemen. We are the vanguard. Most of the 321st Battalion is bogged down in Kudla pass. Only us 'Kazaki', the 1st Company, pushed through. We must now use this advantage and seize control of the main supply arteries in this region of Chernarus before the CDF have time to react. If we can capture and hold just one settlement near the cost we will have a supply route for reinforcement when the 321st arrive. We must punch through to that goal now with vigor. We must reach Pavlovo, Bor or Kozlovka and hold them at all costs, and we must do this before 1800hrs. By then the CDF will have rallied to seal us in. But, if we can secure one village by 1800, we will then have two hours to take the remaining two. Beyond that, there will be no hope. We're not completely isolated, however. There is an airfield here and if we can hold it we can organize some CAS to support the tank rush. Relax cossacks! This is a walk in the park. To your tanks!</English>

          <English>In the summer of 2008, the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade and 1st Armored Regiment of the Chernarussian Defence Force launched 'Operation Northstar'. The intention behind this counter-insurgency campaign was to neutralize the threat of Chernarussian communist guerillas. These forces had almost gained control of the entire Northern Province and mountainous regions of the Central Province. During the summer campaign, the CDF succeeded in recapturing most of the insurgent-held territory; there now remain just a few areas in the border mountains where the 'Chedaki' presence is still considerable. A few days ago, the brigade CO ordered airmobile elements of the 4th to assault this insurgent-held territory and retake control before several ChDKZ bands regroup in the area between Krasnostav-Berezino.

He said I sounded like his father, my Gramps, who fought the Nazis in WWII. I think he was a bit in awe of me actually. It felt very strange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I still don't see how helping the ChDKZ equates to fighting terrorists. NAPA bombed Moscow and they should get what they deserve, but why fight the CDF - the Chernarussian army? I don't understand it. Maybe NAPA is supported by the old Chernarussian government, who knows? They certainly don't bother discussing the politics of the situation with me! I'm sure the President is doing the right thing though. He would know best after all. It's just that from what I've seen so far, the ChDKZ look like terrorists themselves...</English>

          <English>Elektrozavodsk harbour is currently held by the ChDKZ unit Sotnya 2. The rest of the town is being captured by elements of the old government at this very moment.

Our troops (a mechanized rifle squad and a T-90 MBT) will advance from the north and try to neutralize the enemy assets in town. We must break this siege.

                        Those communist fuckers control almost the entire country. They've built a checkpoint in the nearby village - Stary Sobor - and now they're digging in more and more. Some of the NAPA guys and I decided it's gotta stop, right here. We're going to take out Jarda Brezina, a profiteer who collaborates with the commies, doing deals at our expense and helping them get their claws into everything. That bastard's always kissed the shoes of the rich and powerful, so it will be a good riddance. We also know the ChDKZ have a BRDM in Sobor. We want to take it out as well. Of course we're planning to shoot as many communists as possible too. The civvies, however, must not be harmed - except Brezina of course. Native Chernarussians seldom sympathize with those Red bastards. Yesterday in the pub we came to a conclusion. It wasn't easy to agree, but it's becoming more and more clear that the Yanks will ditch us, so we need to take things into our own hands.
                        Since I have no real combat experience I'm the designated getaway driver. I've gotta get us out of there – any who survive. But I swear, if they call me Petya one more time... I'm nervous. Can't fall asleep.

          <English>In August the Chernarussian Red Star Movement launched a large-scale counter-attack on government controlled territories. The island of Utes, home to a small CDF training regiment and coastal guard helicopter detachment, came under assault. 'Grupa Abramov', a ChDKZ insurgent group, captured Utes after prolonged and heavy fighting. After a final battle around the ruined church at Strelka the CDF were defeated and the ChDKZ began to reinforce the island. They currently use it as a base of operations, covering the southern coast of Northern Chernarus. The 27th MEU must retake Utes before they can launch operation Harvest Red.</English>

          <English>We can expect reinforced-company sized opposition with no airpower and only light combat vehicles. These will be concentrated around key military installations or at posts in the urbanized areas around Strelka and Kamenny. Our Air Combat Element have denied the OPFOR precious air and sea supplies so we expect them to be low on ammo and materiel (although the military installations may yet contain significant supplies). There are no signs of coastal defences or minefields and the garrison is likely to be spread thinly across the whole island. Creating a bridgehead and holding it should be simple. The civilian population were expelled from Utes after the invasion so we are free to use all conventional force. </English>

          <English>The first troops of the Ground Combat Element should establish a bridgehead on the southern coast of Utes at 0745 Zulu. You should set up an FOB and provide basic infrastructure for incoming units (LVSP, barracks, service point). After executing an assault on OPFOR units defending Strelka and seizing the infantry base north of the landing zone, you should advance north to the main OPFOR base. The main objective is the OPFOR command post situated somewhere inside the triangle running Kamenny - old CDF harbor – Kamenny harbor.

Once the final CDF troops defending the &lt;marker name="ruin"&gt;church ruins&lt;/marker&gt; in the village of Strelka were defeated, insurgents began to reinforce the island, providing a base for their operations against the CDF coastal fleet.

        <Key ID="str_combat_diary_situation">
          <English>The war began today at 0320 Zulu. Batallion-sized OPFOR and BLUFOR forces moved to contact; so far engagements of patrol elements are being reported across the whole AO. The front line is still not established, as both us and OPFOR employ mainly mobile units in order to gather intel. In the coming hours, the performance of units in this battlespace could decide the course of the whole conflict.</English>
