        <Original>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are usually homemade bombs deployed unconventionally and often used by guerrillas to ambush military convoys. In the Iraq War starting in 2003, IEDs accounted for the majority of coalition forces casualties. The explosive devices are made from a wide range of materials and use many different detonators, charges and initiation systems. This makes them incredible hard to guard against.</Original>

        <Original>Graduating from Yale in 2003, Reynolds joined the CIA. Working as a field operative in Europe, a series of disagreements with his superior regarding operations in the Green Sea Region, led him to be posted to the political backwater of Sahrani in 2006. Despite warning of a potential flashpoint in the region, Reynolds was ignored, and the situation exploded, vindicating his abilities as field officer. Following a series of operational successes, Reynolds was responsible for the extraction of intelligence from Nikola Bardak and worked in conjunction with Czech Special Forces during the capture of Aslan Radayev. His final CIA-based assignment saw Reynolds investigate the slaying of a top Chernarussian Geologist in Karzhegistan in June 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During the course of his final investigation, Reynolds established close connections with Black Element private military company.</Original>
