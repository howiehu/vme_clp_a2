          <Original>The company's been scrambling all over the place to pick up the contracts floating around this wasteland. The drawdown of coalition forces has left this country fat with contracts and contractors. You can see 'em everywhere: a melting pot of cold professionalism and raucous aggro. So many damn Yanks; fucking Americans.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Seems like ION snagged a plump contract - the protection of UN inspectors. Rumour is they've had a tip off about potential WMDs. Jesus, it's taken them long enough - but it sounds like another goose chase to me. 'Fighting the good fight', that's what my mate tells me - well, we'll see; aye, with maniacs like Dickie working along side us, we'll just have to wait and see about that.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We're to be deployed directly into Zargabad, and I'm getting that same feeling as from Op. Crim-Lance: a shit storm waiting to happen. Only redeeming feature is that I'm not directly responsible for the lives of these lads. I'm in control of my own life. Well, that's not strictly true, I've been assigned to Tanny's team - so I'll have to watch out for that old bastard.. and at least I know someone's watching my back too. </Original>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The company have assigned our team to move in and provide protection for our new clients - the arrival of UN investigators at the U.S. Air base in Zargabad.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We expect the helicopter insertion to be nothing more than a formality, but the recent increase in guerilla activity has broadened the scope of our contract.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Add to that the fact the draw-down of troops is thinning out security on the ground, we need to keep our eyes open at all time. Check your contract for the full formalities.

          <Original>We're into the grind, but it was to be expected. Today we're assigned to the Nango industrial facility. Our clients have been digging around the outskirts of Zargabad for the last couple days, looking for more exact evidence. The situation seems secure enough, and we've got no reason to expect any trouble; we're in control.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The NTA have been pretty active in the area, by the sounds of it, pounding the fuck out of anything with the merest hint of a threat. So resistance is pretty thin on the ground. My old mate Stevo told us to keep an eye on them, though, and I will do. The talk is that they can be bought for a tenth of the price of a PMC. And with the amount of cash floating around this hell hole, that's your own private fucking army.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Only problem brewing is between Tanny and Dickie. I honestly don't know if its a mutual disdain for each other, or just what Tanny calls 'craic and bantar'. Aye, I've seen where Tanny's 'good craic' gets him on a Friday night in Glasgow city centre - and it's not too pretty. I should keep an eye on the old bastard, but I know he can look after himself.

&lt;br/&gt;And this Dixon guy - Dickie or Tricky, or whatever - he seems like he's got enough rounds to spend for us all. Sometimes companies let in contractors that we just don't wanna be there.

          <Original>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The company have assigned our team to provide security for the clients, in the area directly surrounding the Nango Industrial Facility, in the north-west of Zargabad.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We need to provide security for as long as the clients need to search for evidence at this facility. I expect this should take no longer than two hours at the longest. Any longer, and our presence will begin to attract unwelcome attention.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Reports suggest that guerilla activity has died down following the botched raid on the client's arrival, but the local community are reported to be unhappy about our increased presence within the region.

          <Original>Despite the protests concerning our operation in Nango, the Client team's investigation bore fruit. We're assigned to escort the client convoy into central urban Zargabad shortly to locate and temporarily detain a contact.

&lt;br/&gt;The disgruntled Zargabad civvies will have doubtless alerted local factions to our presence in Zargabad. Reynolds reminded us of our ROE, but told us to keep alert. The company's been keen to show a responsible face since the Elektrozavodsk debacle in '09 - but I don't think they're about to put their contractors at risk. We've got to keep control of the situation.

&lt;br/&gt;We must remember that we're just a glorified taxi service; we have no offensive capability. With the Yanks focusing upon leaks along the Ardistan border, and our lads all but pulled back to the coast, there's not going to be any Chally tanks to call up in a shit storm. Tanny says that the best we have to rely upon is the NTA - and that's certainly the most worrying piece of information I've received today.</Original>

&lt;br/&gt;The company have assigned our team to escort the clients through to a location in central Zargabad. Information recovered at the Nango Facility has directed them towards a contact residing there.

&lt;br/&gt;The company have assigned our team to escort the clients through Central Takistan, en route to the 'Proving Grounds'. U.S. Air Control has grounded our flight, so we're having to proceed via the vehicles.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Black Betty, our armoured SUV with minigun attachment, has been authorised for deployment. Team Sword will move forward with Betty, and the clients will follow with Team Shield.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The route is expected to be fairly wild; yet, be careful with your shots, and ensure to avoid non-combatant casualties.

          <Original>Returning to Takistan reminded me of why I left my lads in the Paras in the first place. Those fucking hills; this relentless dirt and the ruthless grind. There's no control; this isn't our place. Not that where we are now is any better. The 'Proving Grounds' - just another place to die - another place to be forgotten. This place has the stench of death hanging all around it. Stay long enough, you become part of it yourself.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We're contracted to do a job far outside our remit here. Dixon's a bloody maverick - thinking he's commander in Reynolds' absence. If I didn't know all the orders come from above, we'd be staying right where we are - no mistake. Not that I'd invest much faith in the decisions of those above us. I'm beginning to lose faith in Ruce. He needs to believe these weapons exist. He needs to vindicate his own presence; needs to have a validation for tearing about this country - a justification for the men - my friends - who have lost their lives in this damnable goose chase.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The company - Reynolds - they just keep taking the cash. It's us lads on the ground that need to worry about the bloody consequences. There's no semblance of control, no pragmatism. I just need to survive long enough for this operation to be scrapped. I have no investment - no responsibility. I just need to get back. Fulfil my duties at home.</Original>

&lt;br/&gt;We still don't know who instigated the hi-tech raid on the facility last night, but it's alerted local factions to our activity, for sure. Radio chatter has exploded, and you should certainly be expecting a morning raid.

          <Original>Good Lord, this bullshit just get's thicker by the hour. Reynolds knows I don't have combat experience as a bloody pilot.

Something's not right here, and I can't quite tell exactly what it is.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We've agreed a bonus to the contract - and, sure, it's no small sum. Still, it's blood money not worth dying for. At least I'm in control of my own situation again.

Hell, I don't know what's better right now - or what's worse.</English>

&lt;br/&gt;Our new clients have determined that the materials cannot be allowed to fall into the international community's hands. This eventuality would risk major economic and political problems with the east.

          <Original>Today's task is a simple search and recovery operation. We've had to draft in contractors to provide an air drop for key supplies. They'll drop the cargo over the designated zone; you move in and recover them.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Airstrips in central Takistan are still closed - there's just too much risk associated with bringing in big birds with all the AA activity in the area, and we cannot afford a big push to clear out the resistance in light of this draw-down.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The locals are fractious and, if we don't get these supplies as soon as possible, it's likely we'll lose their support - undoing all the good work we've achieved so far.</Original>

&lt;br/&gt;A lot of good guys have been giving me some pretty solid advice. Reduce airspeed on approach, release the cargo slightly in advance of the drop zone. Sounds simple, right? Sure - then factor in the AA cover..

          <Original>A private company was brought in to drop medical supplies for the local population - I have no idea why; I'm sure we're more than capable of executing the operation. Outsourcing has been gaining more and more traction in recent months - and I for one don't like it one little bit.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We're yet to properly gauge the drop's distribution; hopefully, we've got a tight clustering.  The last thing we need is crates spread out all over the goddamn country. We've got limited support - only one truck and some light backup.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We've had several reports about rogue NTA officers with plans of their own for these supplies - it's partly why we haven't trusted them with the delivery. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that we're not the only ones after these precious resources.</Original>

          <Original>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We've got a two-stage contract on our hands, and the rare opportunity to impress some big players within the UN deployment.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Air Team Romeo is tasked fly into the area and dispatch the cargo. A UN ground team, Juliet, is tasked to recover the cargo, providing protection against any threats that arise. 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;I've got it on good authority that we should expect trouble. All airstrips in the region are off limits due to increased AA activity in the region. The source is unknown. Maybe corrupt elements of the New Takistani Army, maybe fractious guerilla groups; the situation - as always - remains unclear.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This operation will go a whole lot smoother if Romeo and Juliet coordinate well, and their cargo doesn't end up spread out over the whole damn country.

&lt;br/&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We may have a serious situation. Our security convoy - Team Shield, tasked with protecting UN officers - dropped off the grid just minutes ago.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It's possible that comms are down, but I've authorised a second security detail, Team Sword, to move in and confirm.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In truth, we don't know what to expect. The UN were in the area to meet with local Takistani elders, who had some sort of new information. They were invited guests and no trouble was expected.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We cannot let any harm come to the clients, I've worked too hard to get us access to sensitive operations - we mess up now, and ION's presence in the region is as good as over.
